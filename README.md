# in-a-flash
In a Flash is a flashcard app made with Vue. Users can make their own flashcards and decks, study, and quiz themselves on their flashcards.

UPDATE 11/22/2023: The newest restructuring decks update may crash if you have used In a Flash before this update, as the deckCollection variable stored in your browser's local storage is no longer compatible with the one that the app uses now. If the app inexplicably crashes, please clear the site's local storage in your browser and try again.
